At work, I am building a set of dashboards for a client. In preparation, I've decided to take a look back at the fundamentals of good design.

Good design reduces that complexity and makes decisions easier to make. 

One of my favorite designers is Dieter Rams, a German designer who inspired Apple design. He laid out his design strategy in 10 principles. In italics, I score my project against the principles.

1\. Good design is innovative

_My design can be better, I need to think about what makes this client unique. It is easy to make a cookie cutter dashboard. But, to make it innovative, I need to better understand what the client needs and how they will use it._

2\. Good design makes a product useful

_The dashboards are bringing together tangled masses of data into elegant views. I am making data useful._

3\. Good design is aesthetic

_I need to take another look at the spaces between my panels._

4\. Good design makes a product understandable

_I  need to make sure that there are enough text boxes and descriptions so that anyone can pick it up._

5\. Good design is unobtrusive

_Conditional columns, bar charts, tables, and the occasional doughnut._

6\. Good design is honest

_I have resisted the temptation to try and awe the client with chord charts and tree maps. Usually, the flashiest visualizations are the least useful._

7\. Good design is long lasting

_I designed the underlying structure so that it is easy to change. I have an over the top calendar table. I parametarize everything. It takes more time on the front end, but makes it simple to make changes._

8\. Good design is thorough down to the last detail

_I have measures under the hood that I need to rename for clarity._

9\. Good design is environmentally friendly

_I haven't even thought about this._

10\. Good design is as little design as possible

_Here I succeed._
